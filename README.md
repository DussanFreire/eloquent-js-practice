JavaScript is the language of the web, and Eloquent JavaScript is a fantastic resource to master it. In this repository, you’ll find:
* Key concepts broken down chapter by chapter.
* Code snippets that demonstrate important ideas.
* Challenging exercises and their solutions.
* My thoughts, notes, and “aha!” moments.
