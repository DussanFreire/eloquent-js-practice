# Chapter Notes: Eloquent JavaScript

* JavaScript (JS) is also known as ECMAScript, with version 6 (2015) having the most impact.
* Atomic parts of JS include values (the data stored in bits) and operators (used to manipulate values).
* Number type uses 64 bits, representing up to 18 quadrillion values. The largest whole number is 9 quadrillion.
* Fractional numbers are expressed with a dot (e.g., 2.333) or scientific notation (e.g., 2.333e8).
* Arithmetic rules follow standard math precedence.
* Special numbers include Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (not a number, e.g., 0/0).
* Strings represent text and are enclosed in ", ', or `. They can include special characters using a backslash (\).
* Unicode is used to assign numbers to characters, and 16 bits represent each character in JS.
* String concatenation uses +, and template literals allow embedding expressions inside strings using ${}.
* Unary operators (e.g., typeof) work with one value, while binary operators (e.g., +) work with two.
* Boolean values are true or false, often produced by comparison operators.
* Logical operators include &&, ||, and !, with specific precedence rules.
* The ternary operator (A ? B : C) returns B if A is true, otherwise C.
* Empty values like null and undefined signify the absence of meaningful data.
* Type coercion automatically converts data types during operations but can result in NaN.
* Use === to avoid type coercion in comparisons.
* Logical operators (||, &&) use short-circuit evaluation, meaning they only evaluate whatâ€™s necessary for the result.
* The ?? operator returns the right-hand value if the left-hand value is null or undefined.
